elevator
========

Elevator program in javascript and python
Currently the program is only in javascript and randomly sends the elevator, 
but will be using a Python webservice to select the elevator to send. 
Also, will be adding statistics and tracking of the number of people on the 
elevator and the wait times.
Just open the HTML file in FireFox. Change the initialize command in the source to 
change the size of the elevators and floors.
